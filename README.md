# :dizzy: Sample Node SDK App
Barebones Slack app made with the Slack Node SDK. Copy the .env.example file and rename it to '.env', and replace the variable values with the corresponding information from the Slack API.
Go to api.slack.com, click on the Slack app you'd like to use, and go to the 'Install App' section. The Slack token will be the 'Bot User OAuth token.'
